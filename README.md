# switcheroo
very much wip but kinda works

## why
1. I honestly just need a window switcher on macOS (like [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)) where the mouse follows focus (which the Raycast builtin switcher cannot afaict), and I don't like cycling through windows constantly with [Alt-Tab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos).
2. procrastination

## acknowledgements
- [Alt-Tab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos) and [yabai](https://github.com/asmvik/yabai) for documenting private macOS apis, as well as inspiration for a lot of the core logic
- [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.) for making my life very difficult
